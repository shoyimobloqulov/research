                            <h4>1. Summary Writing</h4>
                            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The article by Fogal (2024) explores the concept of
                                collaborative writing, particularly how collaborative and independent writers interact
                                with writing spaces. The study provides a longitudinal analysis of how these two types
                                of writers adapt to and utilize writing environments over time. Using a mixed-methods
                                approach, Fogal examines both qualitative and quantitative data to uncover how
                                collaborative writing influences the writing process and how different writers perceive
                                and engage with writing spaces. The research concludes that collaborative writing
                                fosters deeper engagement with writing spaces, while independent writers tend to focus
                                more on content without extensive interaction with external resources.</p>

                            <h4>2. Critical Review</h4>
                            <p><strong>Strengths:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The article provides a thorough longitudinal analysis, offering insights into the
                                    dynamics of writing processes over time.
                                </li>
                                <li>The combination of qualitative and quantitative methods strengthens the validity and
                                    reliability of the findings, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the
                                    phenomena.
                                </li>
                                <li>The research focuses on real-world applications, especially for second language
                                    writers, making it highly relevant to educators and researchers in the field.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>While the article provides a rich analysis, the sample size may limit the
                                    generalizability of the findings. A broader, more diverse group of writers might
                                    yield different insights.
                                </li>
                                <li>The study could have explored more diverse writing spaces, including digital
                                    platforms, which are increasingly important in modern writing processes.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Validity and Relevance:</strong> The methodology appears sound, with the use of
                                both longitudinal and mixed methods. The findings are relevant to the field of second
                                language writing and offer practical insights for educators and researchers. However,
                                the limitations in sample diversity and scope of writing spaces slightly diminish the
                                research's external validity.</p>

                            <h4>3. Comparison Task</h4>
                            <p><strong>Comparison with Goshu and Gebremariam (2024) on teacher-student writing
                                    feedback:</strong> Both Fogal (2024) and Goshu & Gebremariam (2024) explore elements
                                of writing and how these affect the writing process. While Fogal focuses on the
                                collaboration vs. independent writing dynamic, Goshu and Gebremariam delve into the role
                                of teacher feedback in improving second language learners’ writing. Both studies involve
                                second language writers but differ in their focus. Fogal’s article uses a longitudinal
                                and mixed-methods approach to analyze how writers interact with writing spaces, while
                                Goshu and Gebremariam use teacher-student conferences to explore feedback mechanisms.
                            </p>
                            <p>Methodologically, Fogal’s study is more observational and focuses on the behavior of
                                writers in naturalistic settings. In contrast, Goshu & Gebremariam’s research is more
                                intervention-based, examining how feedback changes writing outcomes. Both articles are
                                valuable in understanding writing processes but address different aspects of the writing
                                experience.</p>

                            <h4>4. Personal Connection</h4>
                            <p>Reflecting on the article, my field of study in educational psychology resonates with
                                Fogal's focus on collaborative writing. The article highlights the importance of
                                collaborative environments in fostering cognitive and emotional engagement, which aligns
                                with theories in educational psychology that suggest peer interactions enhance learning.
                                My personal experience with group projects in educational settings also supports the
                                idea that working together on writing tasks improves motivation and outcomes.</p>

                            <h2>5. Role Play</h2>
                            <p><strong>Presentation at a Conference:</strong><br>
                                "Good morning, esteemed colleagues. Today, I’ll present my research on collaborative
                                writing and how writers engage with different writing spaces. Over the course of my
                                study, I observed both independent and collaborative writers in action, examining how
                                they orient to writing environments.<br><br>
                                The findings are quite revealing. Collaborative writers, over time, develop a deeper
                                interaction with their writing spaces, often utilizing external resources and feedback
                                from peers to improve their work. On the other hand, independent writers tend to focus
                                more on the content itself, showing less interaction with external inputs.<br><br>
                                Through a combination of qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys, I’ve concluded
                                that the writing space is not just a physical or digital environment but a catalyst for
                                cognitive engagement in the writing process. My study highlights the importance of
                                collaboration for second language writers, as it provides them with greater
                                opportunities for feedback and revision. This study contributes to our understanding of
                                the cognitive processes involved in writing and how we can design better learning
                                environments for writers in the future.<br><br>
                                Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your questions and discussions."
